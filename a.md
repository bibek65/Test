**User Stories**

-   Implement Continuous Integration Pipeline
-   Establish Deployment Automation
-   Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
-   Enhance Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story 1:**

**Title:** Implement Continuous Integration Pipeline

**Description:** Implement seamless continuous integration process to ensure that code changes are automatically validated and integrated into the main branch

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Jenkins pipeline configured to automatically build and test the code upon each commit.
2.  Automated unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks integrated into the CI process.
3.  Build artifacts generated and stored in a centralized repository.
4.  Notification system set up for build success/failure to team via email or messaging platform.

**Estimation**

Baseline Effort: 5 story points

**Rationale:**

-   Complexity: Medium - Implementing a Jenkins pipeline involves integrating multiple tools, configuring build scripts, and ensuring compatibility with different types of applications.
-   Dependencies: Low to Medium - Integration with version control systems, testing frameworks, and deployment platforms can introduce dependencies.
-   Skill Level: Medium to High - Team members should be familiar with CI/CD concepts, build tools, and the technology stack in use.

**User Story 2:**

**Title:** Establish Deployment Automation

**Description:** Automate the deployment process to the staging environment to ensure consistency and reduce manual errors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  The deployment process should be triggered automatically upon successful completion of the CI pipeline to target environments (e.g., staging, production) consistently.
2.  Configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet) should be utilized for infrastructure provisioning.
3.  Integration with CI pipeline for automatic deployment to staging.
4.  Rollback mechanism in case of deployment failure.

**Estimation**

Baseline Effort : 8 story points

**Rationale:**

-   Complexity: High â€“To establish deployment automation it involves many process like scripting deployment processes, handling infrastructure changes, and coordinating with different services. The complexity increases with the number of environments and services.
-   Dependencies: Medium to High - Integration with CI/CD pipelines and proper configuration management tool setup are critical dependencies.
-   Skill Level: High - Team members should have expertise in scripting, deployment strategies, and configuration management tools.

**User Story 3:**

**Title:** Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Description:** Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate manual tasks and facilitate continuous delivery.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Infrastructure resources (e.g., servers, databases, networks) should be defined and managed by IaC tool such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation
2.  Infrastructure code should be version-controlled and documented

**Estimation**

Baseline Effort : 5 story points

**Rationale:**

-   Complexity: Medium to High - Implementing IaC involves learning and utilizing tools, defining infrastructure, and ensuring proper version control. Complexity increases with the size and complexity of the infrastructure.
-   Dependencies: Medium - Integration with version control systems and collaboration with the development team for application and infrastructure changes.
-   Skill Level: Medium to High - Team members should be proficient in IaC tools and understand the infrastructure requirements.

----------

**User Story 4:**

**Title:** Enhance Monitoring and Alerting

**Description:** Monitoring and alerting capabilities to receive timely alerts and monitor the health of infrastructure to proactively detect and mitigate issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) should be integrated for monitoring for key metrics such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and application-specific metrics
2.  Thresholds defined for critical metrics.
3.  Alerting system configured for immediate notification.

**Estimation**

Baseline Effort : 5 story points

**Rationale:**

-   Complexity: Medium - Setting up monitoring and alerting involves selecting and configuring monitoring tools, defining relevant metrics, and setting up alerting rules.
-   Dependencies: Low to Medium - Integration with collaboration platforms and coordination with development teams for application-specific metrics.
-   Skill Level: Medium - Team members should have experience with monitoring tools and understanding of system and application metrics.
